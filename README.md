# Etch-a-Sketch DOM Project

## Overview
A browser-based sketchpad that demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. The grid responds to mouse hover, creating a drawing effect similar to an Etch-a-Sketch.

## Features
- Generates a 16x16 grid dynamically using JavaScript
- Grid cells change color on mouse hover
- Button allows user to input a custom grid size (max 100x100)
- Grid resizes while maintaining fixed container dimensions
- Layout built using Flexbox for responsive grid behavior

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Hover your mouse over the grid to draw.
3. Click the "Resize Grid" button to enter a new grid size.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event listeners)

## Project Goals
- Practice creating and manipulating elements via JavaScript
- Improve understanding of Flexbox layout
- Implement interactive user input and basic event handling
